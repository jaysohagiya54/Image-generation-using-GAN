**Image Generation using Generative Adversial Network with help of Tensorflow and python**


A hands-on project that involves creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model in Python with the TensorFlow library. This project focuses on implementing a generator and discriminator network to generate realistic data samples from random noise and distinguish between real and fake samples. Through training, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic data, while the discriminator becomes more adept at differentiating between real and fake samples. By exploring GAN architectures and loss functions, this project offers a practical understanding of deep learning concepts and their application in generating synthetic data.
